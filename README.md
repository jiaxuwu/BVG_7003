The Biopython Project is an international association of developers of freely available Python tools for computational molecular biology.
The goal of Biopython is to make it as easy as possible to use Python for bioinformatics by creating high-quality, reusable modules and classes. Biopython features include parsers for various Bioinformatics file formats (BLAST, Clustalw, FASTA, Genbank,…), access to online services (NCBI, Expasy,…), interfaces to common and not-so-common programs (Clustalw, DSSP, MSMS…), a standard sequence class, various clustering modules, a KD tree data structure etc. and even documentation.

Requirement
-----------
**Python 3.7 or later** --see http://www.python.org 


Biophyton installation
----------
using::

  pip3 install biopython
  
To check the function if Biopython is working in python:


>>> import Bio
>>> print(Bio.__version___)
